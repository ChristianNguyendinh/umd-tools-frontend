        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <div style="width:90%; margin: 1% 5%;">
            <p>When first registering for CS Upper Levels, I didn't know which ones filled up the quickest. Being a rising Junior at the time, I didn't have the credits to get into whichever course I wanted, and was afraid I would get permission to take a course, only for it to fill up before my registration block. So I decided to monitor the number of open seats per day for registration period to get a better idea of which classes are the most popular, so I can better plan which courses I will take in future semesters.</p>

        <h2>Getting the Data</h2>
        <div style="width:90%; margin: 1% 5%;">
            <p>Data is gathered via a script that scrapes data from the UMD api that provides data to the UMD Schedule of Classes page. Data is collected every night after registration times have ended.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <div style="width:90%; margin: 1% 5%;">
                <p>The site runs using NodeJS with ExpressJS for the web framework. It uses sqlite as the database currently. May switch to something like MongoDB or a more robush SQL if the need arises. D3 is used for drawing the graphs so that we can customize details at will. Besides that its just standard HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.</p>
