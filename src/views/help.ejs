        <p>The application pretty simple to use. The only component currently is a 'Charts' page where you can view line charts depicting how fast a upper level CS course fills up by day. The page is depicted below:</p>
        <br />
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
            <img src="/img/screenshot.png" width="60%" style="border: 5px solid black;" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>Enter a desired course in the top search bar. A list of valid courses will appear in the dropdown as you type. Hit search, and a chart will be generated and added to the view based on the chosen course.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The layout buttons on the top right can be toggled to have the charts either displayed 2 per line, or 1 graph per line. 1 Per line can make it easier to see finer details.</p>
        <br />
        <p>On the top left there is a date form that allows you to filter which days the charts will show data for.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Something something semester toggle</p>
        <br />
        <p>The charts themselves are pretty simple. An 'X' button in the top left to delete the chart from view. Each section will be represented by a different colored line. The legend will tell you which section number each color maps to.</p>
